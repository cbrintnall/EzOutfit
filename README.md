A Rimworld mod dedicated to making it faster and easier to create outfits.

## Basic Usage

1. Open up the assign menu
2. Open up "Manage Outfits"
3. Click the new "Create From" button
4. Select a pawn who's current outfit you'd like to use as a template

Once selected, a new outfit will be created using the selected pawn's apparel as a template. This can be accessed under the outfit label "[pawn's name]'s outfit."

### Additional Usage

There are a few other QoL changes with this mod. There is now an additional button in the pawn assignment menu that allows immediately dropping all tainted / tattered apparel. 

### Mod Compatibility

This mod is proudly compatible with Assignment Copy which features similar, but well paired functionality.
