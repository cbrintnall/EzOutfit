A Rimworld mod dedicated to making it faster and easier to create outfits.

## How to use

1. Open up the assign menu
2. Open up "Manage Outfits"
3. Click the new "Create From" button
4. Select a pawn who's current outfit you'd like to use as a template

Once selected, a new outfit will be created using the selected pawn's apparel as a template. This can be accessed under the outfit label "[pawn's name]'s outfit."

## Planned Features

This is meant to be a relatively simple mod, but there is some QoL changes I'd like to add:

- [ ] Setting the quality range for an outfit
- [ ] Easier way to manage whether tainted is allowed or not
- [ ] Simple options menu for above
